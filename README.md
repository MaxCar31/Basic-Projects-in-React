# React Basic Projects Collection

This repository is a collection of my personal projects as I learn and explore React. Each project is a step in my journey to understanding React and its ecosystem.

## Getting Started

These projects were bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), a modern build setup with no configuration.

## Running the Projects

After cloning the repository, you can run each project with:

```bash
npm install
npm start
